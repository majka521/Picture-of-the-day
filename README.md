**Picture of the day** is a simple application, whose purpose is draw a random picture once a day from a given database. Additionally, under the picture is a button that allows new draw (without changing the "picture of the day"). You can use the app to draw meme, photo from your holiday, or any image from your own database. For copyright reasons, the images are from **[pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)**, which are only free for commercial use and no attribution required.

> NOTE: If you want to use this application remember to rename the database. Each image should be named "data(number).jpg". Also remember change a number of random images in Math.random() in App.js
